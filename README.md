# Sorting Algorithm Visualization App

## Overview
The Sorting Algorithm Visualization App is an interactive Android application designed to demonstrate various sorting algorithms through engaging visualizations and animations. It serves as an educational tool for learners and enthusiasts to understand the complexities of algorithms in a simple, visual format.

## Features
- **Algorithm Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, including Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and others.
- **Data Visualization**: The app visualizes data sets as bar graphs, making it easier to observe how different algorithms work.
- **Interactive Animation**: Watch sorting algorithms in action with smooth, animated visualizations.
- **Customization Options**: Users can adjust parameters like data set size and sorting speed to explore algorithms under different conditions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Android Studio
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Android SDK

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Wasim1429/visort.git
   ```
2. Open Android Studio and import the project.
3. Build the project to resolve dependencies.
4. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device.

## Usage
